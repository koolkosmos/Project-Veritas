# Project-Veritas
Project Veritas is an experimental framework that studies when and why deepfake detectors fail.
Rather than proposing a new detection model, this project treats a standard deepfake detector as a probe and evaluates how its reliability changes under controlled temporal and distributional shifts using the FaceForensics++ dataset
